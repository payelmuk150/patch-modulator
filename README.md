CKM and CSM represent a class of general flexible patching and striding strategies which allows flexible patching in vision transformer based PDE surrogates. Across a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, CKM and CSM are shown to dramatically improve the long term stability of video-like prediction tasks. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across architecturesâ€”establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling in PDE surrogate tasks.
